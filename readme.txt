Short description: Pathvisiojs comes to replace obsolete Pathvisio web applet. Diff Viewer allows to see differences between different versions of the same path. It is also based on old Java web applet. Implementing Diff Viewer as a plugin for Pathvisiojs will bring: * Expanding accessibility of plugin to all devices supported by Pathvisiojs * Testing and improving Pathvisiojs API and multi-instance * Serving as an example with documentation for Pathvisiojs plugins development

The work focused on 3 aspects of the pvjs diagram viewer, which can now be found here:
